## Overview

DailyScrawl is a simple app designed to cultivate a habit of daily writing. In a world full of distractions, DailyScrawl offers a unique and minimalist environment for writers, thinkers, and anyone looking to express their thoughts freely. Our mission is to encourage users to dedicate a small portion of their day to writing, reflecting, and exploring ideas in a focused manner.

## The DailyScrawl Experience

Every day, users are presented with a blank canvas and a challenge: write for 10 minutes. This simple premise is at the heart of DailyScrawl, creating a space where thoughts can unfold unimpeded by the outside world.

### Features

- **Daily Writing Timer**: Each session lasts for 10 minutes, encouraging short, focused periods of writing.
- **Snooze Option**: Need more time? Users can snooze the timer twice per session, each time adding an additional 5 minutes.
- **Secure Account Creation**: Users can create an account to save their daily writing, making it easy to track progress over time and revisit past reflections.
- **Minimalist Design**: With a user-friendly interface, DailyScrawl removes all distractions, allowing users to focus solely on their writing.

## Why DailyScrawl?

Writing every day, even for just 10 minutes, can have profound benefits on mental clarity, creativity, and personal growth. DailyScrawl makes this practice accessible to everyone, regardless of their writing background. Whether you're a seasoned writer looking for a new routine, a beginner hoping to start a writing habit, or simply someone in search of a quiet space to gather your thoughts, DailyScrawl is for you.

### A Space for Your Thoughts
